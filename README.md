# Hardhat Boilerplate

## Why ?

Thought to have a fast way of bootstraping projects with best practice's in mind. Having linters, prettiers, standards on how to commit, and changelog creation & maintenance.

---

## How ?

This is achieved using several hardhat plugins, and external known packages.

---

## Tools

This boilerplate includes:

- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- [Solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint)
